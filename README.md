OnboardX â€“ Streamlining the Welcome Experience:

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!
We've all seen it: the chaotic first day for a new hire. Missed introductions, forgotten equipment, and a pile of paperwork. It's a stressful experience for everyone involved. I built OnboardX to change that.

OnboardX is a Salesforce project designed to automate the entire employee onboarding process from start to finish. It takes the manual guesswork and repetitive tasks off the HR team's plate, ensuring every new employee has a smooth, welcoming, and productive start.

--> Key Features
OnboardX is more than just a checklist; it's a complete system built with some of Salesforce's most powerful tools.

--> Smart Automation Engine
At the heart of OnboardX is a powerful Record-Triggered Flow that kicks into gear the moment a new employee is added. It automatically creates essential onboarding tasks, such as:

Setting up an official Email ID.

Assigning a company laptop.

Scheduling the HR orientation session.

--> Crystal-Clear Dashboards
Get a bird's-eye view of the entire onboarding pipeline. The custom Reports & Dashboard provide instant insights into:

How many employees are being onboarded each month.

Which tasks are pending and who is responsible.

A breakdown of onboarding activities by department.

--> Built-in Safeguards
To ensure data is always clean and accurate, I've implemented Validation Rules. These simple but powerful rules prevent common errors, like ensuring an employee's start date is always before their end date and that every employee is assigned to a department.

approvals Seamless Approval Workflows
Need a manager's sign-off? The built-in Approval Process handles requests, like remote work arrangements, smoothly. Managers are automatically notified and can approve or deny requests with a single click.

--> Secure by Design
Using Profiles & Permissions, the system ensures that everyone has access to exactly what they need, and nothing more.

HR Team: Can manage employee records and onboarding processes.

Managers: Can view their team's progress and approve requests.

System Admin: Has full control over the system's configuration.

--> Technology Behind the Magic
This project was built using core Salesforce administrator tools, demonstrating a practical understanding of the platform's declarative capabilities.

*--> How It Works in 4 Simple Steps
Add New Hire: An HR team member adds a new employee's record in Salesforce.

Tasks Auto-Created: The system instantly generates the three standard onboarding tasks and assigns them.

Track Progress: HR and managers monitor the status of all tasks through the central dashboard.

Handle Approvals: If the employee requests to work remotely, the manager receives and approves the request through the formal approval process.

I built this project individually to deepen my Salesforce skills and create a portfolio piece that solves a real-world business problem.
